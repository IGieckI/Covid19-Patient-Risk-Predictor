# COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is high or low risk of death from COVID-19 based on a set of patient information. It compares the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Perceptron, and a Neural Network.

## Data

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset?resource=download) used consists of anonymized patient data. Each patient is represented by a feature vector, which includes various measurements and patient attributes. The target variable is a binary class indicating whether the patient is high or low risk.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The models are trained using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance. The performance of each model is evaluated based on several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

## Results

The results of the model comparisons are presented in a table for easy comparison. Additionally, the training process for the neural network is visualized through accuracy and loss curves.
